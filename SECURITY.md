## Security Best Practices

When using this node:

1. **Never hardcode credentials** - Always use n8n's credential system
2. **Use dedicated wallets** - Don't use your main Solana wallet for automation
3. **Limit funds** - Store only necessary amounts (0.1-0.5 SOL + 1000-10000 CHECKHC)
4. **Rotate API keys** - Regenerate keys periodically
5. **Monitor usage** - Check API logs regularly for suspicious activity
6. **Secure your n8n instance** - Use HTTPS, strong passwords, and proper authentication

## Data Handling

This node:
- âœ… Does NOT store any credentials locally
- âœ… Does NOT log sensitive data
- âœ… Transmits all data over HTTPS only
- âœ… Uses n8n's encrypted credential storage

All data processing happens on PhotoCertif's backend, which follows industry-standard security practices.
